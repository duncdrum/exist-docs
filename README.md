new documentation prototype based on pretty-docs theme.

## Why
This prototype is based on recent discussions about how to improve exist-db's documentation. While it is working, it is far from complete. There are some screenshots and thoughts on how this would be an improvement in the [wiki](https://github.com/duncdrum/exist-docs/wiki)

## Requirements
*   [exist-db](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html) version: ``3.0.4`` or greater
*   [ant](http://ant.apache.org) version: ``1.10.1`` \(for building from source\)

## Installation
1.  Download  the ``exist_docs-3.0.0.xar`` file from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/duncdrum/exist-docs/releases) page.
2.  Open the [dashboard](http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html) of your eXist-db instance and click on ``package manager``.
    1.  Click on the ``add package`` symbol in the upper left corner and select the ``.xar`` file you just downloaded.
3.   You have successfully installed exist_docs into exist.

### Building from source
1.  Download, fork or clone this GitHub repository
2.  There are two default build targets in ``build.xml``:
    *   ``dev`` including *all* files from the source folder including those with potentially sensitive information.
    *   ``deploy`` is the official release. It excludes files necessary for development but that have no effect upon deployment.
3.  Calling ``ant``in your CLI will build both files:    
```bash
cd exist_docs
ant
```
   1. to only build a specific target call either ``dev`` or ``deploy`` like this:
   ```bash   
   ant deploy
   ```   

If you see ``BUILD SUCCESSFUL`` ant has generated a ``exist_docs-3.0.0.xar`` file in the ``build/`` folder. To install it, follow the instructions [above](#installation).
